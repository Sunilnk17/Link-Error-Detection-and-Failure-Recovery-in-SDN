1.Open the Terminal application on your computer (Windows users will use PuTTY).

In the Terminal window, use the SSH client on your computer to start an SSH session to the Mininet VM.

 ssh -Y mininet@192.168.56.101

In the Terminal window, which is now running an SSH session connected to the Mininet virtual machine, start an Xterm:

 xterm -sb &

2.The MiniEdit script is located in Mininet’s examples folder. To run MiniEdit, execute the command:


$ sudo ~/mininet/examples/miniedit.py

MiniEdit has a simple user interface that presents a canvas with a row of tool icons on the left side of the window, and a menu bar along the top of the window.

3.Add eight switches and three controllers using the same method: Click on the Switch tool and add switches, then click on the Controller tool and add controllers.

4.To start the simulation scenario, click the Run button on the MiniEdit GUI. In the terminal window from which you started MiniEdit, 
you will see some messages showing the progress of the simulation startup and then the Miniedit CLI prompt 
(because we checked Start CLI box in the MiniEdit preferences window).

5.First, check the switch configurations in the network simulation to verify that everything is set up correctly.
 You can run the MiniEdit menu command, Run ? Show OVS Summary to see an listing of switch configurations.
 In this case, we can verify that each switch is listening to the correct controller on the correct port.

6.Then, run a ping command to send traffic between host h1 to h8.

mininet > pingall
In the MiniEdit console, you see the results of the ping command
